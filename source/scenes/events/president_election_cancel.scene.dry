= Christian Socials propose presidential election be given to parliament

# The English wikipedia page saying this was scheduled for 1934 seems to be wrong, their source just doesn't say that as well as basically everything I've read agreeing it was supposed to be in 1931.
# Source is Karl Renner: Austria by Jamie Bulloch. I reading it on Kindle so I don't know the page but it's location is 1475 of 2382

Due to constitutional amendments made in 1929, a presidential election is now set for October 1931. The SDAPO has already begun to campaign for Karl Renner, who has spoken at 50 mass meetings already. Former chancellor Seipel of the Christian Socials is contemplating entering the race as well.

However, the Christian Socials in parliament argue that conducting an election during the depression would be too costly and propose that they should select the president instead.
