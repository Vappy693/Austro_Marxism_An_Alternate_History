This is a game of alternate history. While historical accuracy is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

For more information on the politics and government of the German Republic, see the "Library" page on the top left. If this is your first time playing the game, it is strongly recommended that you read at least some of this information.

It is a dark time for Austrian democracy. The Austrian right is increasingly polarized against democracy, while the great depression has hurt Austria. 

Now, the task of Social Democracy is to prepare for the next election. The former government of Johann Schober and the minority Vaugoin government are unpopular, but it is unclear if we will be the ones too gain.
